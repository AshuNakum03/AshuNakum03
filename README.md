## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ashutosh Nakum


Radhe Radhe!

For the past two years, I've been working in UI/UX, branding, web design, web development, and app development for Indian and international clients. I also work with CMS tools like WordPress, Webflow, Framer, Wix, and Bubble. Going solo has been a rewarding experience, but it's also incredibly challenging to handle everything myself.

As Nakum Ashutosh, I provide a comprehensive suite of solutions to help businesses achieve their goals:

1. UI/UX Design
2. Web Design
3. Web Development
4. Social Media Marketing
5. IT Consultancy
6. CMS Solutions: Expertise in platforms like WordPress, Framer, Webflow, and more.

And the best part? Want to see what I can do for your project? I'm offering free consultations! Check out my [goofydesign](https://goofydesign.in/) and book an appointment. It's completely free, and I'd love to chat about your needs. Let's make something awesome together!
